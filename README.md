<h1 align="center">I'm Aryansh Kurmi</h1>
<h4 align="center">Hey there! 🌟 I'm an Electrical Engineering grad from <a href="https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/"> IIT Ropar </a> (Class of 2022). But guess what? My heart beats for coding and solving real-world puzzles using tech wizardry!

<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>

- 👨‍💻  I rocked the software scene as a full-time Software Development Engineer at **[CoinDCX](https://coindcx.com/)**. There, I conjured up NodeJS and Ruby on Rails magic.
- 👨‍💻 Before that, I had my intern adventure at **[Business Tech Labs](https://www.businesstechlabs.com/)**, where I was the backend hero.
- 👨‍💻 I interned at  **[Fintract Global](https://www.fintract.co.uk/)** where I wore the frontend developer cape.
- 👨‍💻 Swing by my mystical **[My portfolio website](https://arukurmi.github.io/aryansite/)** to see my spells in action.
- 📄 Here is **[My Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1886vZeTRqPPvchbldM-3D5KE_KChNOs1/view?usp=sharing)**.  Up for some freelancing, internships, or full-time coding adventures.
- ⚡ When I'm not in front of the screen, you might find me in the sports arena or just shooting the breeze over coffee. Life's all about balance, right?
- 📫 Want to ping me? Shoot an email to **arukurmi22@gmail.com**. Let's connect and chat!
